## Reporting

We take Security seriously, so if you have discovered a security risk report it by email to [kiko@barcelli.net](mailto:kiko@barcelli.net) preferably using end-to-end encrypted messages with the following PGP key: [0x70c7d0901133471df2e6e9a8006c13a68e25d3b7](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x70c7d0901133471df2e6e9a8006c13a68e25d3b7).

Our team will assess and handle it accordingly. Please don't disclose security risks publicly until they have been handled by our team.

Your email will be acknowledged within 24 hours, and you will receive a more detailed email response about the actions to be taken to handle your report within 1 week.
